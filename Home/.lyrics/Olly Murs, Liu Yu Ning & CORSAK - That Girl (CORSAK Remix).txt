[Verse 1: Olly Murs]
There's a girl, but I let her get away
It's all my fault, 'cause pride got in the way
And I'd be lying if I said I was ok
About that girl, the one I let get away

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
I keep saying no
This can't be the way it was supposed to be
I keep saying no
There's gotta be a way to get you close to me

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
Now I know you gotta speak up if you want somebody
Can't let them get away, oh no
You don't wanna end up sorry
The way that I'm feeling everyday
(Don't you know) No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken heart
(Don't you know) No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken heart

[Post-Chorus: Olly Murs]
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken heart
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken—

[Verse 2: Liu Yu Ning]
还以为会有回答
说过关于永远的那些话
现在的我每一天 被回忆搜刮
空无一人的大厦

[Pre-Chorus: Liu Yu Ning]
就这一刹那
想承认这就是骄傲的代价
只是一刹那
还以为会有个办法
让时间停在那
不用崩塌

[Chorus: Liu Yu Ning]
我接受所有惩罚
重来一次我不怕
结局会比想象中复杂
这次我不求解答

[Post-Chorus: Olly Murs]
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken heart
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken—
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken heart
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken heart

[Bridge: Liu Yu Ning]
神啊
给我们一张嘴巴
嘴里却只说狠话
你教我种最美丽的花
却看着我毁灭它

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
Now I know you gotta speak up if you want somebody
Can't let them get away, oh no
You don't wanna end up sorry
The way that I'm feeling everyday
(Don't you know) No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken heart
(Don't you know) No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken heart

[Post-Chorus: Olly Murs]
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken heart
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken—
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken heart
Don't you know (No, no, no, no)
There's no home for the broken heart
