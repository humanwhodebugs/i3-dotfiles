[Verse 1]
My love, will you?
Take my hand with virtue?
For time has proved
That I, do love you

[Chorus]
Will we, ever find
A way to make our time last forever?
Because I begin to miss you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
One kiss, from you
And your touch will change
My life and my blue
As long as you stay

[Chorus]
Will we, ever find
A way to make our time last forever?
Because I begin to miss you

Will we, ever find
A way to make our time last forever?
Because I begin to miss you
Will we, ever find
A way to make our time last forever?
Because I begin to miss you
