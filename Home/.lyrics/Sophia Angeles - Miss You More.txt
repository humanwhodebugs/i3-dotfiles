[Verse 1]
This isn't easy to say, 'cause
We haven't talked in a month
And when you see me with him, you'll
Probably think I've moved on
Yeah, I lie to him when
I say that I'm over you
Yeah, I know it's messed up
But the truth is

[Chorus]
Every time I'm with him
It just makes me miss you more
Even though there's someone new
Yeah, they'll never be my cure
And I know they say it helps
But I swear I was feeling better before
I guess I miss you more
I miss, I miss you more
I guess I miss you more

[Verse 2]
Got me thinking 'bout you
Probably more than I should
And I know that it's wrong
But what can I do when

[Chorus]
Every time I'm with him
It just makes me miss you more
Even though there's someone new
Yeah, they'll never be my cure
And I know they say it helps
But I swear I was feeling better before
I guess I miss you more
I miss, I miss you more
I guess I miss you more

[Bridge]
Tell me would you pick up
If I called you right now
So that I could tell you
I miss you?
Tell me would you pick up
If I called you right now
So that I could tell you
So that I could tell you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be with him
I can't do it anymore
I'm not getting over you
Maybe you're the only cure (The only cure)
I'm not ready to move on
Can we go back to how it was before?
I guess I miss you more
I miss, I miss you more
I guess I miss you more
I miss, I miss you more
I guess I miss you more
