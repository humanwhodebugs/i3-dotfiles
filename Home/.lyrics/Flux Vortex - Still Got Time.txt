[Verse 1]
Tell me something, tell me something
I haven't heard before
'Cause I'm restless and I'm dying to know more
Show me something, show me something
I haven't seen before
'Cause I'm tired of the same boats, the same shore

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time, my friend
To leave this hell behind us
We got everything we need to make a change (Ah)
I can't keep pretending I'm right whеre I wanna be
I'm hopelеssly in need of better days (Ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm too young to face the end
But I'm old enough to start again
And I, yeah, I still got time (Time)
The world has tried to pin me down
But I'm running at the speed of light
And I, yeah, I still got time (Time)
Yeah, I still got time (Time)

[Verse 2]
Give me something, give me something
Something worth fighting for
'Cause my heartbeat has been silent for too long
Tell me one thing, tell me one thing
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
I know that you're nowhere near done

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time, my friend
To leave this hell behind us
We got everything we need to make a change (Ah)
I can't keep pretending I'm right where I wanna be
I'm hopelessly in need of better days (Ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm too young to face the end
But I'm old enough to start again
And I, yeah, I still got time (Time)
The world has tried to pin me down
But I'm running at the speed of light
And I, yeah, I still got time (Still got time, time)

[Bridge]
Blood's runnin' through my veins (Yeah)
Still got a little time in me
Won't let it go to waste, oh, oh
There's power in my bones (Bones)
Still got a little time in me
I'm never comin' home (Ooh, ah)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm too young to face the end
But I'm old enough to start again
And I, yeah, I still got time (Still got time, time)
The world has tried to pin me down
But I'm runnin' at the speed of light
And I (I), yeah, I still got time (Still got time, time)
[Outro]
Yeah, I still got time (Time)
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, I still got time (Time)
