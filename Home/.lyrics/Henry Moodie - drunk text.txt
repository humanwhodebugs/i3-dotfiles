[Verse 1]
5th of November
When I walked you home
That's when I nearly said it
But then said, "Forget it" and froze
Do you remember?
You probably don't
'Cause the sparks in the sky
Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke

[Pre-Chorus]
Yesterday, drank way too much
And stayed up too late
Started to write what I wanna say
Deleted the message
But I still remember it said

[Chorus]
I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside

[Verse 2]
April the 7th
And nothing has changed
It's hard to get by
When you're still on my mind everyday
Sometimes I question
If you feel the same
Do we make stupid jokes?
Trying to hide that we're both too afraid to say

[Chorus]
I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up till 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside

[Bridge]
Oh, and here we go again
Destroy myself to keep a friend
Hiding away 'cause I was afraid you'd say no
I wonder if I cross your mind
Half as much as you do mine
If I tell you the truth
What will I lose? I don't know

[Outro]
I wish I had sent you that drunk text at midnight
I was just scared it would ruin our friendship
But I really meant it
I wonder how you would reply
