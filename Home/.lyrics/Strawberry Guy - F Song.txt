[Verse 1]
I know you're not there now
And I know you really care somehow
She said, he does love you
But, well, hey, that's nothing new

[Chorus]
Just don't waste time
You'll never look back, don't go there alone
Just don't waste time
You'll never look back, don't go there alone

[Verse 2]
And I know that he won't see
So I spoke up and they told me
Just move on, you won't need them
So shut your eyes and count to ten

[Chorus]
Just don't waste time
You'll never look back, don't go there alone
Just don't waste time
You'll never look back, don't go there alone

[Verse 3]
I knew that you looked at me
I never really saw you as proud (Oh, no)
You're never really there for me
You never gave me much of a crowd (Oh, no)
I knew that you looked at me
I never really saw you as proud (Oh, no)
You're never really there for me
You never gave me much of a crowd (Oh, no)
